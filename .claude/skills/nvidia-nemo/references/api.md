NVIDIA NeMo™ Customizer is a high-performance, scalable microservice that simplifies fine-tuning and alignment of generative AI models for building domain-specific AI agents. Through an API-first approach, this microservice supports popular customization and post-training techniques such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA), full supervised fine-tuning (SFT), direct preference optimization (DPO), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with continued integration of the latest customization and alignment techniques. For broader reinforcement learning support with advanced RL algorithms and large-scale post-training, explore the open-source NeMo RL library, part of the NeMo framework.NeMo Customizer, part of the NVIDIA NeMo software suite for managing the AI agent lifecycle, enables developers to seamlessly build data flywheels that continuously optimize AI agents for improved performance, efficiency, and cost.

Learn how NeMo Customizer enables developers to fine-tune large language models using domain-specific data—enabling the creation of tailored AI agents for tasks such as customer support, healthcare insights, enterprise automation, and many other applications.

NeMo Customizer provides an easy-to-use API that lets you customize generative AI models. Simply provide the dataset, model name, hyperparameters, and type of customization in the API payload. NeMo Customizer will initiate a job to tune the model, resulting in a customized version.The architecture diagram below illustrates the flow for using NeMo Customizer, letting you seamlessly launch multiple customization jobs. In the depicted scenario, you can utilize NeMo Customizer to create two customization workflows: one for fine-tuning and one for alignment tuning. These outputs, along with NVIDIA NIM™, allow you to deploy a customized model tailored to your specific use case. NeMo Customizer currently supports DPO and GRPO for reinforcement learning (RL). For broader RL support with advanced algorithms and large-scale post-training, explore the open-source NeMo RL library part of the NeMo framework.
