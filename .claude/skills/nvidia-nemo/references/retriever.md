NVIDIA NeMo™ Retriever is a collection of industry-leading Nemotron RAG models delivering 50% better accuracy, 15x faster multimodal PDF extraction, and 35x better storage efficiency, enabling enterprises to build retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines that provide real-time business insights. NeMo Retriever, part of the NVIDIA NeMo software suite for managing the AI agent lifecycle, ensures data privacy and seamlessly connects to proprietary data wherever it resides, empowering secure, enterprise-grade retrieval. NeMo Retriever serves as a core component for NVIDIA AI-Q—a blueprint for building intelligent AI agents—and the NVIDIA RAG blueprint, enabling access to knowledge from enterprise AI data platforms. It provides a reliable foundation for scalable, production-ready retrieval pipelines supporting advanced AI applications.NeMo Retriever microservices set a new standard for enterprise RAG applications, leading the industry with first-place performance across three top visual document retrieval leaderboards (ViDoRe V1, ViDoRe V2, MTEB, and MMTEB VisualDocumentRetrieval).

Build world-class information retrieval pipelines and AI query engines with scalable data extraction and high-accuracy embedding and reranking.

Rapidly ingest massive volumes of data and extract text, graphs, charts, and tables at the same time for highly accurate retrieval.

Boost text question-and-answer retrieval performance, providing high-quality embeddings for many downstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

Enhance retrieval performance further with a fine-tuned reranking model, finding the most relevant passages to provide as context when querying a large language model (LLM).

NeMo Retriever provides components for building data extraction and information retrieval pipelines. The pipeline extracts structured and unstructured data (ex. text, charts, tables), converts it to text, and filters out duplicates. A NeMo Retriever embedding NIM converts the chunks into embeddings and stores them in a vector database, accelerated by NVIDIA cuVS, for enhanced performance and speed of indexing and search. When a query is submitted, the system retrieves relevant information using vector similarity search, and then a NeMo Retriever reranking NIM reranks the results for accuracy. With the most pertinent information, an LLM NIM generates a response that’s informed, accurate, and contextually relevant. You can use various LLM NIM microservices from the NVIDIA API catalog to
